L              Left face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
B              Back face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
D              Bottom face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
M              Slice between L and R moves 90 degrees clockwise  
E              Slice between U and D moves 90 degrees clockwise  
S              Slice between F and B moves 90 degrees clockwise  
SHIFT          Makes all moves anticlockwise until pressed again  
TAB            Makes all moves include their respective middle slice until pressed again  
SPACEBAR       Calls solve function, starts walkthrough, then keep pressing to progress through the walkthrough
