Y13 computer science A Level NEA project focusing on the Rubik's Cube.

I aim to implement a Rubik's Cube simulator inspired by this article, however, I will only be implementing Thistlethwaite's algorithm.

Thanks to The Coding Train (a.k.a. Daniel Shiffman), whose Youtube series helped massively with the graphics part of the code. Thanks also to Ben Botto, whose articles, mentioned above, concerning optimal solvers and indexing permutations/combinations, and code on Github, were invaluable. Thanks also to Jaap Scherphuis, whose website helped me understand Thistlethwaite's algorithm. Last but not least, thanks to Morwen Thistlethwaite for inventing the algorithm of course!
