Y13 Computer Science A Level NEA project focusing on the Rubik's Cube.

### 3D GUI:  

Key&nbsp;            Effect  
R&nbsp;              Right face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
F&nbsp;              Front face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
U&nbsp;              Top face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
L&nbsp;              Left face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
B&nbsp;              Back face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
D&nbsp;              Bottom face moves 90 degrees clockwise  
M&nbsp;              Slice between L and R moves 90 degrees clockwise  
E&nbsp;              Slice between U and D moves 90 degrees clockwise  
S&nbsp;              Slice between F and B moves 90 degrees clockwise  
SHIFT&nbsp;          Makes all moves anticlockwise until pressed again  
TAB&nbsp;            Makes all moves include their respective middle slice until pressed again  
SPACEBAR&nbsp;       Calls solve function, starts walkthrough, then keep pressing to progress through the walkthrough
